        <h3>Night Changes</h3>
		<p>"We're only getting older, baby And I've been thinking about it lately Does it ever drive you crazy
		Just how fast the night changes? Everything that you've ever dreamed of Disappearing when you wake up 
		But there's nothing to be afraid of Even when the night changes It will never change me and you Going out tonight
		Changes into something red Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost".</p>
        <h3>I want to Write You a Song</h3>
		<p>"I want to write you a song One that's beautiful as you are sweet With just a hint of pain For the feeling that I get when you are gone 
		I want to write you a song I want to lend you my coat One that's as soft as your cheek So when the world is cold 
		You'll have a hiding place you can go I want to lend you my coat".</p>
